## Bash configuration

To ensure that both Vim and Neovim will recognize the 256 colors capability of your
terminal, even when you are accessing your system through ssh, put the
following lines in your `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ] || [ "$TERM" = "xterm-256color" ]
then
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    export HAS_256_COLORS=yes
fi
if [ "$TERM" = "screen" ] && [ "$HAS_256_COLORS" = "yes" ]
then
    export TERM=screen-256color
fi
```

## Tests

   - To see at once how some file types are highlighted, open the file
     `test_colorscheme/openFiles.vim` and, in Normal mode, type `:so %`.

   - To see what attributes your terminal support, do `./test_terminal.py`.
